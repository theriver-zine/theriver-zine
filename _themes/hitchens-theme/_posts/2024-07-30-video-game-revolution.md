In November 2023, young crowds waving Palestinian and Malaysian flags gathered at the Malaysia-Palestine Square to protest Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza. Where’s that square, you ask? Not in Kuala Lumpur, that’s for sure. With teens under 15 banned from protesting in Malaysia, they turned to Roblox—a Minecraft-like MMORPG available on pretty much every device, including your phone. 

This isn’t the first time video games have provided a platform for activism. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, people used Pokémon Go to coordinate actions without raising suspicion. In 2020, Black Lives Matter activists staged virtual protests in Animal Crossing to spread their message while avoiding the hazards of COVID-19.

Often dismissed as mere entertainment, games can be as political as any art form and successfully harnessed for socio-political and activist goals. Moreover, whether out of fear of police brutality, health concerns, or otherwise, not every person might be comfortable engaging in street protests. Virtual worlds, whose boundaries cut across cultures, nationalities, age, social, and class identity, offer a valuable alternative for reaching and broadening a movement. 

The times are a-changing: the revolution might not be televised—but it just might be played.[^1]
