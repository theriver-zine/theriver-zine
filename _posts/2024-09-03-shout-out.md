Een universiteit wil sociale rechtvaardigheid doceren maar niet leven: mooi om zien, dergelijke hypocrisie.

Dear K, I changed my number and didn't tell you. We used to meet and get worked up together about bullshit bureaucracy, the unethical ethics committee and the social injustices of our department. When I tell you that I see these same patterns on a wider scale now with Palestine, you shut down. What do you expect?, you ask me, this is just how the world is. I don't know what I expected from the world, but I didn't expect this apathy from you, and it hurts. 

Rondom ons staat de politie en worden studenten gearresteerd. Zij eisen aandacht voor een genocide. Een decaan verlaat het gebouw want het weekend begint.

I am told that the dean is working tirelessly on issues of social safety. She says she is working daily to find the right balance between what is required and what is just. Perhaps if she tried to join these two together she would feel less tired.
