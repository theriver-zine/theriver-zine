Resistance is what people do to survive. Resistance is what one has to do else they will collapse in despair. Resistance flows from the heart. It does not involve or imply the death of the heart, or the sacrifice of one’s morals, of one’s love for humanity, of one’s empathy for another, of one’s identity — for the greater goal to be achieved through a cold-blooded calculation. On the contrary, it widens the heart, puts one’s morals into practice, fills and confirms one’s identity. Stemming from compassion and solidarity, it quenches the thirst for peace and justice. Resistance is not rooted in revenge; it doesn’t even come from the will to fight for justice. It comes from the love inscribed in the heart of any freedom-loving person.

People of the heart hate doing what they do when they resist oppression. They hate the discord, the struggle, the destruction, clashes and quarrels — yet they do all that for this is what the heart yearning to breathe dictates. Out of love, they must resist.
<br><br>
In this sense, resistance is the supreme moral principle as it demands the observance of one’s fundamental right to exist flowing from the most profound plains of the heart. It’s not a calculated infringement on another’s right to exist, but a brave assertion of the right to exist of the only things that sustain the life in this world: hope, relations and love.
