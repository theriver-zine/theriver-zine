Dear comrades, colleagues, collaborators in genocide, 

A warm welcome to this new academic year, where business shall absolutely not continue as usual. 

Did you really think that we would disperse and disappear on a summer breeze? Sorry to disappoint, but we are the fresh air in this stinking institution, and we invite you to breathe in deeply and to let out a collective scream, chant, wail or even a laugh – whatever it takes to bring humanity into the space between these cold brick walls. 

If you are not (yet) with us, and if you are feeling nostalgic for the status quo, perhaps you can start by asking yourself the question, is your gezelligheid hiding genocide?
