  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 20px;"><strong>How was it?</strong></td>
    <td>Beautifully written, and painful of course. Through Kanafani's descriptions, I really got a sense of the different motives each character had for taking this dangerous journey and their lack of other options.</td>

  <tr>
    <td style="padding-right: 20px;"><strong>What stood out for you?</strong></td>
    <td>This book felt so relevant to today that I had to keep consciously reminding myself that it was actually published in 1962. So in this way, it was a very powerful reminder of how long the Palestinian struggle has been going on, and how so many generations have been shaped by (and lost to) these inescapable external forces.</td>

    <td>Anyone who enjoys connecting to history through prose and well-written characters. It's quite short, so very accessible in that sense.</td>
